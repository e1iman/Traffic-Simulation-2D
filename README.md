simulation of traffic movement (microsim) in 2D physics, but 3D visualisation. Also traffic light system based on fuzzy logic, and traffic analisys via heatmaps and traffic flow zone detectors.

Accordint to plan i need to tell sopmething about myself! but that's stupid, and i'm too lazy, So here it goes, some random text i write that mimics changes to this brand new branch!! lel get rect
